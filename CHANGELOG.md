## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Unified Bottom Control Bar** — Sleek control panel with panel toggles and menu buttons
- **Multi-select Panel Toggles** — Enable any combination of △ Flavor, 〰 P(t), 📊 P(E) panels
- **Scroll Zoom** — Mouse wheel zoom in/out on neutrino sphere (0.5x to 2x)
- **11 new tooltip positioning tests** — Comprehensive edge case coverage

### Changed
- Moved menu actions (Share, Learn More, Settings, Help) to bottom control bar
- Removed hamburger menu in favor of always-visible action buttons
- Improved probability plot aspect ratio (taller for better curve visibility)
- Added bottom padding to main visualization area to prevent panel overlap

### Fixed
- Tooltip viewport overflow — tooltips now use fixed positioning with viewport clamping
- Ternary plot tooltip positioning — tooltips render correctly inside embedded panels

### Added
- **Learn More Panel** — 8 educational sections covering neutrino physics
- **Settings Panel** — Language selector and density presets
- **KaTeX Math Rendering** — Beautiful LaTeX equations in educational content

- Double rendering in RichText component math parser

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
