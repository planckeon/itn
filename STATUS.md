# Project Status: Imagining the Neutrino

## Current State

The project has completed a major refactor and cleanup resulting in:

- **Simplified Tech Stack**: 
  - p5.js for all visualization
  - Alpine.js for UI state management
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Vite for bundling

- **Improved Architecture**:
  - Modular code organization
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Better type definitions
  - Removed legacy Three.js/Plotly.js code

- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Optimized physics calculations
  - Efficient rendering pipeline
  - Proper caching of results

## Key Features Complete

✅ Core neutrino oscillation visualization  
✅ Interactive parameter controls  
✅ Probability plotting  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Comprehensive testing  
✅ Documentation updates  

## Next Steps

- Add additional visualization modes  
- Improve mobile experience  
- Expand educational content  
- Enhance performance monitoring
