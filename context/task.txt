write me a simple, static, animated website that demonstrates/visualizes neutrino oscillations (in vacuum and in matter) and the associated probabilities as they vary with time/length and energy

alongside this, I wanna visualize the neutrinos flying in space in 3d and animate their evolution with time/length as they're flying (for some given energy)

color each neutrino flavor and display the flavor with the highest probability (and anything in between using intermediate colors) when you are visualizing the neutrino in vacuum flying through space

make the website dark themed. I want the visualizations to be 3b1b styled (use p5.js for this potentially if needed)

add a third (tau) flavor, make the 3-flavor mixing more detailed, visualize just a single neutrino in the backdrop in 3b1b style as it flies through space and changes between flavors (coded by colors)

make the time evolution adjustable by a slider to slow/speed up the simulation

okay, I want this to be a moving animation with the camera in the same reference frame as the neutrino, i.e., fixed on the neutrino, which is in the center of the screen

the neutrino should move against the backdrop of stars (add motion blur to make it smooth if needed)

also, make the background completely black

I want the plots to also update dynamically with the neutrino animation

make the neutrino to appear to be flying diagonally in the screen
